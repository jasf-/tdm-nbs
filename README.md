<h3>To replicate our workshop, execute the notebooks in the following order:</h3>

1. [About Constellate](https://github.com/ResearchDataServicesNU/Python-TextAnalysis/blob/master/1.AboutConstellate.ipynb)
2. [Creating a dataset in Constellate](https://github.com/ResearchDataServicesNU/Python-TextAnalysis/blob/master/2.CreatingaDatasetinConstellate.ipynb)
3. [Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/ResearchDataServicesNU/Python-TextAnalysis/blob/master/3.GettingStartedwithJupyterNotebooks.ipynb)
4. [Getting started with Python](https://github.com/ResearchDataServicesNU/Python-TextAnalysis/blob/master/4.GettingStartedwithPython.ipynb)
5. [Significant terms](https://github.com/ResearchDataServicesNU/Python-TextAnalysis/blob/master/5.SignificantTerms.ipynb)

<b>Recommendation:</b> Use [Constellate's environment](https://constellate.org/notebook/own/) to load the notebooks. Requires Northeastern affiliation and JSTOR account.

Alternatively, this personal Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jasf-/tdm-nbs/master) can be used to launch notebooks. Please note that not all functions will work outside the Constellate environment.
